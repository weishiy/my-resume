## Deployment

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages using the `b1` branch. Only the content from the `dist` folder is pushed to the `b1` branch for deployment. The `dist` folder itself is not includedâ€”only its contents are moved to the root of the branch.

### Deployment Methods

---

#### ðŸš€ Method 1: Manual Deployment

1. **Switch to the `b1` branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout b1
   ```

2. **Clear all existing files:**
   ```bash
   git rm -rf .
   ```

3. **Copy the contents of the `dist` folder from `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main -- dist
   mv dist/* .      # Or use 'mv dist/* dist/.* .' to include hidden files
   rm -rf dist      # If using Unix-based terminal
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist
   ```

4. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: update b1 with dist content"
   git push origin b1
   ```

#### âš¡ Method 2: Deploy Using Script

1. **Ensure you're on the `main` branch, then build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh

   The script will:
